abstract = {Industrial standards define safety requirements for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) in industrial manufacturing. The standards particularly require real-time monitoring and securing of the minimum protective distance between a robot and an operator. This paper proposes a depth-sensor based model for workspace monitoring and an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) User Interface (UI) for safe HRC. The AR UI is implemented on two different hardware: a projector-mirror setup and a wearable AR gear (HoloLens). The workspace model and UIs are evaluated in a realistic diesel engine assembly task. The AR-based interactive UIs provide 21–24% and 57–64% reduction in the task completion and robot idle time, respectively, as compared to a baseline without interaction and workspace sharing. However, user experience assessment reveal that HoloLens based AR is not yet suitable for industrial manufacturing while the projector-mirror setup shows clear improvements in safety and work ergonomics.}

abstract = {Human-aware robot navigation is the key to facilitate the deployment of mobile robots into human–robot shared environments. Although many efforts have been made in this regard, almost all of the existing works focus on the constraints such as user comfort and social rules, while ignoring to consider user preferences. And it is expected that the mobile robot is able to navigate in the user-desired areas according to user preferences, e.g., navigating at low speed in the bedroom. To this end, this paper studies the problem of allowing users to control the robot’s working areas to ensure robot aware navigation based on their preferences. To address the intrusiveness of additional facilities or devices to users, we propose a non-intrusive solution by deploying the virtual areas that are non-physical areas but are respected by the mobile robot while performing navigation tasks. Farther, an interactive interface is developed to support the common (non-expert) users to flexibly define the desired areas and specify the navigation behavior of the robot according to their preferences. The proposed solution is fully evaluated through extensive experiments. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of our approach, and show that the mobile robot can change its navigation behavior in user-defined areas according to user preferences.
